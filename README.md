# Computer Vision by Practice

**This repository contains a collection of computer vision tasks and mini-projects I've completed while exploring different models, datasets, and visual recognition problems. Each task focuses on a specific computer vision concept and includes code, explanations, and results.**

**The goal is to document my practical CV learning journey and build a foundation for more complex computer vision applications.**
